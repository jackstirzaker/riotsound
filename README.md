# IoTSound — v5.0

> **Actively maintained community fork** of [iotsound/iotsound](https://github.com/iotsound/iotsound), originally developed by Balena as balenaSound.
> In October 2025 Balena issued a [call for maintainers](https://github.com/iotsound/iotsound/issues/689) but did not transfer the project to volunteers. This fork picks up that work.

| `SOUND_DEVICE_NAME` | Hostname and broadcast name for Bluetooth, AirPlay, Spotify Connect, and UPnP | `iotsound` |

#### Logging

| Variable | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `LOG_LEVEL` | Universal debug switch — `debug` enables verbose output in all services and keeps the `support-toolkit` container running | `info` |

#### Audio output

| Variable | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `SOUND_VOLUME` | Default volume (0–100) | `75` |
| `AUDIO_OUTPUT` | Output device — `AUTO`, device name substring, or device number | `AUTO` |
| `AUDIO_LOG_LEVEL` | Override audio log verbosity: `ERROR`, `WARN`, `NOTICE`, `INFO`, `DEBUG` | `LOG_LEVEL` or `NOTICE` |

#### Microphone input & filtering

| Variable | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `AUDIO_INPUT` | Input device — `AUTO`, device name substring, or device number | `AUTO` |
| `AUDIO_INPUT_LOOPBACK` | Monitor mic through speakers (`true`/`false`) | `false` |
| `AUDIO_MIC_INPUT_VOLUME` | Mic input level 0–100 (only used when loopback is active) | `35` |
| `AUDIO_INPUT_EQ_DISABLED` | Disable all mic EQ filters (`true`/`false`) | `true` |
| `AUDIO_INPUT_HIGHPASS` | Highpass filter cutoff Hz — removes rumble (0 = off) | `130` |
| `AUDIO_INPUT_LOWPASS` | Lowpass filter cutoff Hz — removes harshness (0 = off) | `15000` |
| `AUDIO_INPUT_HIGHPASS_Q` | Highpass filter Q factor (bandwidth) | `1.0` |
| `AUDIO_INPUT_LOWPASS_Q` | Lowpass filter Q factor (bandwidth) | `1.0` |
| `AUDIO_INPUT_BOXY_CUT` | Peaking gain at 500 Hz (dB) to reduce boxy sound | `-2` |

| `SOUND_INPUT_LATENCY` | Input loopback latency in ms | `200` |
| `SOUND_OUTPUT_LATENCY` | Output loopback latency in ms | `200` |

#### Multiroom (Snapcast)

See [docs/MULTIROOM.md](docs/MULTIROOM.md) for a full explanation of roles, group names, and election behaviour.

| Variable | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `SOUND_MULTIROOM_ROLE` | `auto` (play-triggered master), `host` (always master), `join` (always client), `disabled` (standalone) | `auto` |
| `SOUND_GROUP_NAME` | Multiroom group — devices with the same name sync together | `default` |
| `SOUND_GROUP_LATENCY` | Group latency advertised in mDNS TXT records; informational for discovery/UI | `750` |
| `SOUND_MULTIROOM_BUFFER_MS` | Snapserver stream buffer in ms — increase if all Snapcast clients stutter | `400` |
| `SOUND_MULTIROOM_CAPTURE_MS` | Master-side pacat capture latency in ms | `50` |
| `SOUND_MULTIROOM_PA_LATENCY_MS` | PulseAudio sink-input buffer for snapclient output in ms | `100` |
| `SOUND_MULTIROOM_LATENCY` | Per-device snapclient latency offset in ms; applies to any running snapclient, including the master-local client. Use a higher value on earlier devices or a lower/negative value on later devices. | `400` |
| `SOUND_MULTIROOM_MASTER` | Override master IP — skips mDNS discovery (for networks where mDNS is blocked) | unset |

#### Multiroom roles

| Role | Streaming plugins | Joins multiroom | Becomes master |
|---|---|---|---|
| `auto` | ✅ Bluetooth, AirPlay, Spotify | ✅ | ✅ On first play |
| `host` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ Always |
| `join` | ❌ Stopped (device invisible to streaming apps) | ✅ | ❌ Never |
| `disabled` | ✅ | ❌ Standalone only | ❌ Never |

**Standalone mode** — set `SOUND_MULTIROOM_ROLE=disabled` for devices that should play independently. Disabled devices route `balena-sound.input` directly to `balena-sound.output` and do not use Snapcast.

**Groups** — devices with the same `SOUND_GROUP_NAME` sync together. Different group names form independent groups that can play different audio simultaneously on the same network.

Role and group name can be changed live from the web UI at `http://<device-ip>/` without restarting services.

#### Spotify Connect (librespot)

| Variable | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `SOUND_DISABLE_SPOTIFY` | Disable Spotify Connect entirely (set to any value) | unset |
| `SOUND_SPOTIFY_BITRATE` | Streaming bitrate in kbps: `96`, `160`, or `320` | `160` |
| `SOUND_SPOTIFY_INITIAL_VOLUME` | Volume level when Spotify connects (0–100) | `50` |
| `SOUND_SPOTIFY_USERNAME` | Spotify username for credential auth (use with `SOUND_SPOTIFY_PASSWORD`) | unset |
| `SOUND_SPOTIFY_PASSWORD` | Spotify access token for credential auth | unset |
| `SOUND_SPOTIFY_DISABLE_NORMALISATION` | Disable loudness normalization (set to `1`) | unset |

#### Bluetooth

| Variable | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `SOUND_DISABLE_BLUETOOTH` | Disable Bluetooth entirely (set to any value) | unset |
| `BLUETOOTH_DEVICE_NAME` | Bluetooth broadcast name | `balenaOS <first 4 of UUID>` |
| `BLUETOOTH_HCI_INTERFACE` | Bluetooth adapter to use (e.g. `hci0`, `hci1`) | `hci0` |
| `BLUETOOTH_PAIRING_MODE` | `SSP` (Secure Simple Pairing) or `LEGACY` (PIN required) | `SSP` |

#### AirPlay

| Variable | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `SOUND_DISABLE_AIRPLAY` | Disable AirPlay entirely (set to any value) | unset |

#### Karaoke

| Variable | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `SOUND_DISABLE_KARAOKE` | Disable Karaoke entirely, including the player and fetcher containers (set to any value) | unset |
| `KARAOKE_QUALITY` | Maximum downloaded video height | `720` |
| `KARAOKE_MAX_QUEUE_PER_SINGER` | Maximum queued songs per singer | `3` |
| `KARAOKE_SYNC_OFFSET_MS` | Default local speaker A/V sync offset in ms, from `-2000` to `2000` | `0` |

### Web UI

Access the control panel at `http://<device-ip>/` for:
- **Volume control** — device output volume slider
- **Multiroom** — role selector, group name dropdown with discovered groups, live master IP, client latency display
- **Multi-room buffer** — Snapcast latency slider
- **DAC overlay** — set a custom device tree overlay for DAC boards
- **Device management** — restart services, reboot, shutdown

## Audio Devices

### Output priority (AUTO)

1. HiFiBerry DAC (best quality)
2. USB audio devices
3. HDMI audio
4. Built-in 3.5mm jack (fallback)

### Input priority (AUTO)

1. USB audio devices / USB microphones
2. Built-in microphone

Check the startup logs to see detected devices:

```
[STEP] Available Hardware Output Sinks:
  1        alsa_output.usb-0d8c_C-Media_USB_Audio_Device-00.analog-stereo
  2        alsa_output.platform-soc_sound.stereo-fallback
  (Set AUDIO_OUTPUT=<n> to force a specific device)
```

Use `AUDIO_OUTPUT=1` to force by number, `AUDIO_OUTPUT=USB` to force by substring (case-insensitive). Same pattern for `AUDIO_INPUT`.

---

## Microphone Input & Filtering

The audio service includes configurable biquad filters for microphone input. Default configuration is optimised for karaoke:

```
AUDIO_INPUT_HIGHPASS = 130    # Removes rumble
AUDIO_INPUT_LOWPASS = 15000   # Removes harshness
AUDIO_MIC_INPUT_VOLUME = 35
AUDIO_INPUT_LOOPBACK = false
```

For detailed filter descriptions see [docs/Audio_Configuration.md](docs/Audio_Configuration.md).

## Motivation

There are many commercial solutions that provide functionality similar to IoTSound — Sonos, WiiM, and others. Most come with a premium price tag, vendor lock-in, and privacy concerns.

IoTSound is an open source project that lets you build your own DIY audio streaming platform without compromises. Bring your old speakers back to life, on your own terms.

## Alternatives

- [moOde Audio](https://moodeaudio.org/) — free, open source audiophile streamer with multiroom support
- [Volumio](https://volumio.com/) — free and premium options
- [piCorePlayer](https://www.picoreplayer.org/) — lightweight, supports local and streaming services
