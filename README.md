# IoTSound (JaragonCR Fork) — v4.7.0

> **Actively maintained community fork** of [iotsound/iotsound](https://github.com/iotsound/iotsound), originally developed by Balena as balenaSound.
> In October 2025 Balena issued a [call for maintainers](https://github.com/iotsound/iotsound/issues/689) but did not transfer the project to volunteers. This fork picks up that work.

## What's different in this fork

### ✅ Completed modernization (v4.0.0 → v4.1.0)

| Change | Details |
|---|---|
| **PulseAudio → PipeWire** | Replaced PulseAudio 15 with PipeWire + WirePlumber on Alpine 3.21. `pipewire-pulse` maintains full TCP 4317 backward compatibility with all audio clients. |
| **Audio block wrapper** | Replaced the abandoned `balena-audio` npm package (4+ years unmaintained) with `PulseAudioWrapper` — a drop-in replacement using `pactl` and Node.js built-ins. Zero new dependencies. |
| **librespot → go-librespot** | Replaced the aging librespot Rust implementation with [go-librespot](https://github.com/devgianlu/go-librespot) for better Spotify Connect stability and zeroconf support. |
| **Node.js 14 → 24 LTS** | Upgraded sound-supervisor from EOL Node 14 to Node 24 LTS. |
| **TypeScript 3.9 → 5.4.5** | Modernized TypeScript compiler and updated tsconfig target to ES2022. |
| **13 CVEs fixed** | Addressed all Dependabot security alerts: `axios`, `express`, `async`, `lodash`, `js-yaml`, `braces`, `socket.io-parser` and more. |
| **Hostname fix** | Fixed Day 1 issue where `${SOUND_DEVICE_NAME}` was never resolved due to balena not supporting docker-compose variable substitution syntax. Replaced with self-contained supervisor API script. |
| **Bluetooth modernization** | Removed fragile `git clone at build time` pattern. Vendored custom `bluetooth-agent` directly into the plugin. Upgraded Python 3.8 → 3.12. Custom changes: wipe paired devices on startup, fix `RECONNECT_MAX_RETRIES` type cast bug. |
| **Logging cleanup** | Removed outdated kernel version comments and verbose debug noise across all containers. |
| **Versionist integration** | Automated changelog generation and semantic versioning via Flowzone. |
| **Hardware audio detection** | Auto-detect output devices (DAC > USB > HDMI > Built-in) and input devices (USB > Built-in) with manual override support. |
| **Microphone filtering** | Configurable PipeWire biquad filters (highpass/lowpass) for voice quality optimization. Perfect for karaoke. |

### ✅ Completed modernization (v4.5.0 → v4.6.0)

| Change | Details |
|---|---|
| **Multiroom 2.0** | Replaced cote UDP pub/sub election with mDNS auto-discovery. Play-triggered master promotion — the device you stream to becomes master instantly. Role system (`auto` / `host` / `join` / `disabled`) replaces the old three-mode system. No manual IP pinning needed. Group names let multiple independent groups coexist on the same network. |

### 🔧 Sprint wrap-up

| Item | Notes |
|---|---|
| **Karaoke support** | Integrated as the `plugins/karaoke` plugin with a Go audience/singer UI, direct MP4 browser playback, local speaker mode, mic loopback, sync timing, history, and a Python/Waitress fetcher sidecar. |
| **UPnP plugin update** | gmrender-resurrect base image update |

### Web UI

Once deployed, access the control panel at `http://<device-ip>/` for:
- **Volume control** — device output volume slider
- **Multiroom** — role selector (auto/host/join/disabled), group name dropdown with discovered groups, live master IP
- **Multi-room buffer** — Snapcast latency slider
- **DAC overlay** — set a custom device tree overlay for DAC boards
- **Device management** — restart services, reboot, shutdown

## Audio Devices

### Automatic Detection

The audio service automatically detects available audio devices on startup and logs them:

```
[STEP] Available Hardware Output Sinks:
  1        alsa_output.usb-0d8c_C-Media_USB_Audio_Device-00.analog-stereo
  2        alsa_output.platform-soc_sound.stereo-fallback
  (Set AUDIO_OUTPUT=<n> to force a specific device)

[STEP] Available Hardware Input Sources:
  1        alsa_input.usb-0d8c_C-Media_USB_Audio_Device-00.mono-fallback
  (Set AUDIO_INPUT=<n> to force a specific device)
```

### Output Priority

By default, devices are selected in this order:
1. HiFiBerry DAC+ (best audio quality)
2. USB Audio devices
3. HDMI audio
4. Built-in 3.5mm jack (fallback)

Use `AUDIO_OUTPUT` to override: `AUDIO_OUTPUT=1` to force device #1, or `AUDIO_OUTPUT=USB` to force USB.

### Input Priority

By default, microphone devices are selected in this order:
1. USB Audio devices (USB microphones, audio dongles)
2. Built-in microphone

Use `AUDIO_INPUT` to override: `AUDIO_INPUT=1` to force device #1, or `AUDIO_INPUT=USB` to force USB.

### Forcing a specific output or input device

Check the startup logs (or the Support logs page at `http://<device-ip>/support`) to see the numbered device list:

```
[STEP] Available Hardware Output Sinks:
  1        alsa_output.usb-0d8c_C-Media_USB_Audio_Device-00.analog-stereo
  2        alsa_output.platform-soc_sound.stereo-fallback
  (Set AUDIO_OUTPUT=<n> to force a specific device)
```

Then set the fleet or device variable:

| Goal | Variable |
|---|---|
| Force output device #1 | `AUDIO_OUTPUT=1` |
| Force USB audio output | `AUDIO_OUTPUT=USB` |
| Force HiFiBerry DAC | `AUDIO_OUTPUT=HiFiBerry` |
| Force output device by full name | `AUDIO_OUTPUT=C-Media` (substring match) |
| Force input device #1 | `AUDIO_INPUT=1` |
| Force USB microphone | `AUDIO_INPUT=USB` |

The match is case-insensitive substring — you don't need the full device name. `AUTO` (the default) uses the priority order above.

## Microphone Input & Filtering

The audio service includes configurable audio filters for microphone input to improve voice quality and remove unwanted noise. This is especially useful for karaoke and voice applications.

### Default Configuration (Optimized for Karaoke)

```
AUDIO_INPUT_HIGHPASS = 120    # Removes rumble and low-frequency noise
AUDIO_INPUT_LOWPASS = 12000   # Removes high-frequency harshness
AUDIO_MIC_INPUT_VOLUME = 40   # Input level (prevents amplification noise)
AUDIO_INPUT_LOOPBACK = false  # Disable mic monitoring by default
```

### Common Configurations

**Studio/Professional Vocals:**
```
AUDIO_INPUT_HIGHPASS = 80
AUDIO_INPUT_LOWPASS = 15000
AUDIO_MIC_INPUT_VOLUME = 50
```

**Karaoke (Default - Recommended):**
```
AUDIO_INPUT_HIGHPASS = 120
AUDIO_INPUT_LOWPASS = 12000
AUDIO_MIC_INPUT_VOLUME = 40
```

**No Filtering (Full Spectrum):**
```
AUDIO_INPUT_HIGHPASS = 0
AUDIO_INPUT_LOWPASS = 0
AUDIO_MIC_INPUT_VOLUME = 40
```

For detailed filter descriptions and more configuration examples, see [Audio_Configuration.md](docs/Audio_Configuration.md).

## Motivation

![concept](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iotsound/iotsound/master/docs/images/sound.png)

There are many commercial solutions out there that provide functionality similar to IoTSound — Sonos, WiiM, and others. Most come with a premium price tag, vendor lock-in, and privacy concerns.

IoTSound is an open source project that lets you build your own DIY audio streaming platform without compromises. Bring your old speakers back to life, on your own terms.

## Alternatives

If you need a more established solution:

- [moOde Audio](https://moodeaudio.org/) — free, open source audiophile streamer with multiroom support
- [Volumio](https://volumio.com/) — free and premium options
- [piCorePlayer](https://www.picoreplayer.org/) — lightweight, supports local and streaming services
